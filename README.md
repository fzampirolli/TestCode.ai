# TestCode.ai â€“ Automated Assessment System with LLMs

Welcome to **TestCode.ai**, a free and open-source platform designed to support automated exam grading with the assistance of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

Its main feature is its high flexibility through a central configuration file (config.yaml). This allows the user to define detailed evaluation rubrics and customize the prompts sent to a Large Language Model (LLM). Additionally, the system integrates the anonymization of submissions, automatic AI-based evaluation, and feedback delivery by email.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Setup** of a complete evaluation environment.
- **Preparation of submissions** from Moodle `.zip` files (unzip + anonymization).
- **Automated evaluation** of programming tasks using LLMs.
- **Automatic feedback delivery** via email.
- **Mapping file** generation for anonymized student folders.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
Clone the repository and make the wrapper script executable:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fzampirolli/TestCode.ai.git
cd TestCode.ai
chmod +x run.sh
````

---

## âš¡ Usage

Run the wrapper script with one of the available commands:

```bash
./run.sh [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]
```

### Main Commands

* `setup`
  Sets up the initial environment (run once).

  ```bash
  ./run.sh setup
  ```

* `prepare <zip_file>`
  Unzips and anonymizes submissions from Moodle.
  The mapping file is saved in `output/mapping.txt`.

* `eval <folder>`
  Runs the AI evaluation on the submissions folder.
  Example:

  ```bash
  ./run.sh eval submissions
  ```

* `email`
  Sends the generated feedback to students via email.

* `check`
  Verifies whether all required scripts are available
  (`setup.sh`, `eval.py`, `send_email.py`, `rename_folders.sh`).

* `-h, --help`
  Displays the help message.

## ðŸ”„ Example Workflow

```bash
./run.sh setup
./run.sh prepare submissions.zip
./run.sh eval submissions
./run.sh email
```
